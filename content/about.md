Welcome to my math blog! I am (shamim akhtar) currently a 2nd year student at Chennai Mathematical Institute, pursuing a double major in Math + CS. Although i suck at CS, i suck more at physics. This blog's main purpose is storage for papers at CMI(quizzes, midsems, endsems, maybe other interesting problems), and just going a tad more into detail about the intricacies (why/what) involved while learning something new and how sigma mathematics is! 
    CMI has been, atleast academically, a stellar place - being surrounded by so many sigmas (seriously, hands down the smartest people i have ever come across) has truly been one of the moments ever - although this sometimes does put me in existential crisis, its still very fun.

    What got me into math?

  I just wanted to aura farm in 6th grade and read through my elder sister's math textbook (class 9,10,11) and slowly realised that it was entirely different from the trash i dealt with previously(and in the future, until 12th)
