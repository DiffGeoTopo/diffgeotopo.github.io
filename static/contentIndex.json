I am (shamim akhtar) currently a 2nd year student at Chennai Mathematical Institute, pursuing a double major in Math + CS. Although i suck at CS, i suck more at physics. This blog’s main purpose is storage for papers at CMI(quizzes, midsems, endsems, maybe other interesting problems), and just going a tad more into detail about the intricacies (why/what) involved while learning something new and how sigma mathematics is!\nCMI has been, atleast academically, a stellar place - being surrounded by so many sigmas (seriously, hands down the smartest people i have ever come across) has truly been one of the moments ever - although this sometimes does put me in existential crisis, its still very fun.\n\n  \n    What got me into math?\n  \n  \n  I just wanted to aura farm in 6th grade and read through my elder sister&#039;s math textbook (class 9,10,11) and slowly realised that it was entirely different from the trash i dealt with previously(and in the future, until 12th)\n\n\n  \n    Miring status\n  \n  \n  Height - 5&#039;7, Weight - 63 kg approx , decently muscular (mainly back and bicep) - best stat - can do 15 strict pullups, curl 15 kgs 7x per hand.\n  Favorite protein source - amul rose lassi - 750 rs for 30 units\n\n\n  \n    Religion\n  \n  \n  Sigma religion (chennai muslim institute)\n"},"algebra-3/index-algebra":{"slug":"algebra-3/index-algebra","filePath":"algebra-3/index-algebra.md","title":"Course Overview","links":[],"tags":["Algebra3","FieldTheory","RingTheory","AlgMidsem","AlgQuiz1","AlgQuiz2","AlgEndsem"],"content":"Instructor : Clare D’Cruz\nFocus: Ring Theory, Field Theory, Elementary Commutative Algebra\n\n  \n    Quiz 1\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    Quiz 2\n  \n  \n  \nInsights :\nProblem 4 : Characteristic is the main issue, and for the case d=3, use generalised eisenstein (x_1+x_2 is prime!)\n\n\n  \n    Midsem\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    Endsem\n  \n  \n  \nInsights :\nProblem 1 (ii) : Is somehow FALSE : Interestingly - if the bottom left entry were a -1, it indeed is an isomorphism\nProblem 2 : The roots simply permute under the map\nProblem 7 : Repeatedly try a “symmetry” exploit - biquadratic along with possibility of complex roots\nProblem 8 : part b - Hilbert Nullstellensatz (Image is C[t], the complex polynomial ring)\nProblem 5 : Trick : construct homomorphism which ensures that the ideal generated by the element is prime!
